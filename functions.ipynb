        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Function**: A block of code that performs a task and is defined using `def` outside of a class. It can be called independently.\n",
        "  Example: `def add(x, y): return x + y`\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Method**: A function that is associated with an object (usually defined inside a class) and operates on that object.\n",
        "  Example: `class MyClass: def greet(self): print(\"Hello\")`\n",
        "  Here, `greet()` is a method.\n",
        "2.Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Parameters** are the variables listed in a function's definition.\n",
        "  Example: `def greet(name):` → `name` is a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Arguments** are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "  Example: `greet(\"Alice\")` → `\"Alice\"` is an argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameters** define what a function expects, **arguments** provide the data.\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, functions can be defined and called in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Regular Function Definition**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")  # Function call\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Function with Default Arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
        "    return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n",
        "\n",
        "greet()         # Uses default\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\")  # Overrides default\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Function with Variable Arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(*args):\n",
        "    for name in args:\n",
        "        print(f\"Hello, {name}\")\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\", \"Bob\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Lambda (Anonymous) Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "add(2, 3)  # Returns 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **5. Function Inside a Function (Nested)**\n",
        "\n",

        "    def inner():\n",
        "        return \"Inner\"\n",
        "    return inner()\n",
        "\n",
        "outer()  # Calls inner function inside outer\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **6. Calling with Keyword Arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name, age):\n",
        "    return f\"{name} is {age} years old\"\n",
        "\n",
        "greet(age=30, name=\"Alice\")  # Keyword call\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### **7. Using `*args` and `**kwargs` Together**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def info(*args, **kwargs):\n",
        "    print(args, kwargs)\n",

        "```\n",
        "4.  What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        " - The `return` statement in a Python function is used to send a value back to the caller of the function.\n",
        "5.  What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        " - In Python, **iterables** are objects you can loop over (like lists or strings), while **iterators** are objects that keep track of where you are in a loop and produce items one at a time using `__next__()`. An iterator is created from an iterable using the `iter()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. . Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        " - Generators in Python are a type of iterator that yield items one at a time using the `yield` keyword, allowing for memory-efficient iteration. They are defined like regular functions but use `yield` instead of `return`.\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        " - Generators are more memory-efficient than regular functions because they yield items one at a time instead of storing the entire result in memory. They also support lazy evaluation, which makes them ideal for working with large data sets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        " - A **lambda function** in Python is an anonymous, single-expression function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It’s typically used for short, throwaway functions, especially as arguments to functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()`.\n",
        "9. . Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        " - The `map()` function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable and returns a map object (an iterator). It's used to transform data efficiently without writing explicit loops.\n",
        "10. . What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        " - * **`map()`** applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns the results.\n",
        "* **`filter()`** selects items from an iterable that meet a condition (function returns `True`).\n",
        "* **`reduce()`** (from `functools`) applies a function cumulatively to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n",
        "11.  Using pen & Paper write the internal mechanism for sum operation using  reduce function on this given\n",
        "list:[47,11,42,13];\n",
        " - Start with the first two elements: 47 + 11 = 58\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, 58 + 42 = 100\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, 100 + 13 = 113\n",
        "\n",
        "Result: 113\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how reduce() accumulates the sum step by step.\n",
